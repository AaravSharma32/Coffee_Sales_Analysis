Coffee Sales Analysis
Welcome to the Coffee Sales Analysis project! This project aims to analyze coffee sales data to uncover trends, performance insights, and customer behavior. The goal is to understand sales patterns, identify peak sales hours, and assess store performance to optimize sales strategies and decision-making.

Project Overview
In this analysis, we focus on several key aspects of coffee sales, including:

Top-Selling Products: Identifying the best-performing coffee products.
Sales Growth: Analyzing monthly sales and orders to track trends over time.
Peak Sales Hours: Determining the times of day with the highest order volumes.
Weekend vs Weekday Sales: Comparing sales performance on weekends and weekdays.
Store Performance: Analyzing individual store performance to identify areas for improvement.
The insights derived from this analysis can help businesses refine their marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement strategies.
